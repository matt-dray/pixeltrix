# pixeltrix 0.0.0.9002

* Went the non-Shiny route and used `locator()` and `image()` for interactivity in the `click_pixel()` function (#2).

# pixeltrix 0.0.0.9001

* Added basic image-click template app [from RStudio](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/image-interaction-basic.html) as the function `pixeltrix()`.

# pixeltrix 0.0.0.9000

* There is no functionality, lol.
