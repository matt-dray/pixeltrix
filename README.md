A work-in-progress R package for interactive pixel art in the plot window.

1. Provide dimensions for a pixel-plotting canvas.
2. It will be plotted as an interactive image.
3. Click pixels to convert them from 'off' to 'on' and vice versa.
4. Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> when you're done.
5. A matrix is returned that encodes your pixel art.
6. ???
7. Profit.

You can install it from GitHub:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")  # if not yet installed
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/pixeltrix")
```

Begin the interactive plot:

``` r
click_pixels(n_row = 8, n_col = 10) -> m
```

Click the pixels to turn 'on' and 'off' pixels. Design a little character or something.

Hit <kbd>Esc</kbd> to finish and you'll get a matrix back that represents your image.

```
